## Description:

A web application to track the whereabouts of equipment shared among a small group of people. I work with a group of web developers, and we have a number of testing devices, as well as some A/V equipment for creating user tutorial videos. I have often wished I knew who had a particular piece of equipment, and this application is an attempt to solve this problem.

The application uses a mostly RESTful model for the following resources:
- Items (the pieces of equipment that are checked out
- Categories (what kind of item is it, e.g. a tablet)
- Users (the people who are using the items)
- Checkouts (each instance of a person "checking out" an item)

I styled the application using Bootstrap via CDN. I added a third-party widget (listed below) to implement date pickers on the site. I am also using a local stylesheet to override/add to the Bootstrap styles.
